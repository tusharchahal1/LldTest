**Decorator Design Pattern**

We’re going to create a Shape interface and concrete classes implementing the Shape interface. We will then create an abstract decorator class ShapeDecorator implementing the Shape interface and having the Shape object as its instance variable.

‘Shape’ is the name of the interface.

‘Rectangle’ class and ‘Circle’ class will be concrete classes implementing the ‘Shape’ interface.

‘ShapeDecorator’ is our abstract decorator class implementing the same ‘Shape’ interface.

RedShapeDecorator is a concrete class implementing ShapeDecorator.

DecoratorPatternDemo, our demo class will use RedShapeDecorator to decorate Shape objects.
